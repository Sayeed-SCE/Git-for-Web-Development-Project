## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch? 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

Answers:
1. Git is an opensource distributed control version system.

2.Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

3. We create branches to encapsualte the new changes, adding new features, and fixing bugs. 

4. Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

5. we use git switch commands to switch between branches. 

6.The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. 
The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.

7.Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

8. The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes.After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to stage the new merged content.The final step is to create a new commit with the help of the git commit.

End of the Homework.
